## Installation

**Make sure you have AlchemyCMS installed.**

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

~~~ruby
gem 'alchemy-richmedia-essences', github: 'AlchemyCMS/alchemy-richmedia-essences', branch: 'main'
~~~

And then execute:

~~~shell
$ bundle install
~~~

## Usage

1) After installing or updating, prepare your database with:

~~~shell
$ rake alchemy_richmedia_essences:install:migrations db:migrate
~~~

2) In your `elements.yml` add one of these essences to your element of choice.

~~~yaml
# elements.yml
- name: video
  contents:
  - name: video
    type: EssenceVideo

- name: audio
  contents:
  - name: audio
    type: EssenceAudio
~~~

## Player customization

This plugin just provides HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` tags and no styling at all. The players will appear as the browser vendors provide.

If you want a cross browser and customizable player with FlashÂ® fallback, then we strongly recommend something like http://mediaelementjs.com/

There is even a gem https://github.com/tobsch/mediaelement_rails that provides everthing for the Rails' asset pipeline.
